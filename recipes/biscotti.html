        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li><br>
            <li>In a medium bowl, beat together the oil, eggs, sugar and anise flavoring until well blended. Combine the flour and
            baking powder, stir into the egg mixture to form a heavy dough. Divide dough into two pieces. Form each piece into a
            roll as long as your cookie sheet. Place roll onto the prepared cookie sheet, and press down to 1/2 inch thickness.</li><br>
            <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on a wire
            rack. When The cookies are cool enough to handle, slice each one crosswise into 1/2 inch slices. Place the slices cut
            side up back onto the baking sheet. Bake for an additional 6 to 10 minutes on each side. Slices should be lightly
            toasted.</li><br>
