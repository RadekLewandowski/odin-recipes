    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>French macarons are <strong> delicate sandwich cookies with a crisp exterior.</strong> Each individual cookie is known as a macaron shell.
    The shells are made without any chemical leaveners and get all of their lift from properly beaten egg whites. If you
    follow the recipe carefully, the cookies have a unique nougat-like, chewy texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 extra-large egg whites</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Buttercream Filling:</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>⅔ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li><br>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until foamy, about 30 seconds.
            Add white sugar and continue to beat until peaks are stiff enough they stay in place when the bowl is turned upside
            down, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Sift 1 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar, almond flour, and salt together twice. Fold into the egg whites until batter is
            creamy and falls slowly off the lifted spatula, about 50 turns with a spatula. Transfer batter to a piping bag fitted
            with a round tip.</li><br>
            <li>Pipe batter onto the parchment paper, using a circular motion to make macarons 1 inch in diameter. Tap the baking sheet
            against the counter about 10 times to release any air bubbles.</li><br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 9 minutes. Rotate baking sheet and continue baking until macarons are shiny and rise
            slightly to form "feet", about 9 minutes more. Peel off the parchment paper and allow to cool completely, about 30
            minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Beat butter, 2/3 cup confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract with an electric mixer until creamy and thick, about 10
            minutes. Transfer filling to a piping bag fitted with a round tip.</li><br>
            <li>Pipe a small amount of filling onto the center of 1 macaron; top with another macaron and press gently to sandwich the
            filling between the two.</li><br>
        </ol>
