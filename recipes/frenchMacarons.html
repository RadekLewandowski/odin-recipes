    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>French macarons are <strong> delicate sandwich cookies with a crisp exterior.</strong> Each individual cookie is known as a macaron shell.
    The shells are made without any chemical leaveners and get all of their lift from properly beaten egg whites. If you
    follow the recipe carefully, the cookies have a unique nougat-like, chewy texture.</p>
